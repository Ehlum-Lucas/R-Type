R-Type is a famous game that we had to do with a structured game architecture.

This Epitech project teach us how to develop an ECS, which can be used to develop a new game.
## Getting Started

You can visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/EpitechPromo2026/B-CPP-500-REN-5-2-rtype-lucas.iglesia/wiki) to see how to install, launch and play the game.

If you are a developper, you can also visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/EpitechPromo2026/B-CPP-500-REN-5-2-rtype-lucas.iglesia/wiki) to develop a new game with our ECS or change some point on our game.
## Installing and Launching

To install the game you can go check the (Release)[https://github.com/Ehlum-Lucas/R-Type/releases] and download the last version of the project.

Now you have two choice, to play to the **Runner** or the **R-Type (online)**:

To play to **R-Type**, you can unzip the folder and launch the binary **client** in the folder **R-Type**:
```bash
./client ip_address
```
But you'll need to have a server hosted by someone on the ip address entered in parameter. To launch the server you'll need to execute the binary **server** in the same folder as **client**:
```bash
./server
```
To play to **Runner**, you can unzip the folder and launch the binary **runner** in the folder **Runner**:
```bash
./runner
```
